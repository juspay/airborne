/**
 * Fetches the release configuration for a specific client.
 *
 * This method should retrieve the latest release configuration from the appropriate source
 * (typically a remote server), parse it into an HPJPApplicationManifest object, and invoke
 * the completion handler with the result.
 *
 * @param clientId The unique identifier for the client application requesting the configuration.
 *                 This ID is used to determine the appropriate configuration variant and
 *                 may affect URL construction, feature flags, or other client-specific settings.
 *
 * @param completionHandler A block to be called when the fetch operation completes.
 *                         The block takes two parameters:
 *                         - manifest: The parsed application manifest on success, nil on failure
 *                         - error: An error object on failure, nil on success
 *                         This block may be called on any queue and should handle thread safety accordingly.
 *
 * @warning The completion handler must be called exactly once, regardless of success or failure.
 *          While the application manager has a release config timeout mechanism that will
 *          eventually proceed with local configuration if no response is received.
 *
 * @note For testing purposes, implementations may provide mock data instead of making
 *       actual network requests.

 *
 * @return A non-null string containing the release configuration URL.

 *
 * @return A non-null dictionary containing HTTP header field names as keys
 *         and their corresponding values as strings. Returns an empty
 *         dictionary if no custom headers are needed.
 *
 * @note This method will not be called if fetchReleaseConfigForClientId:completionHandler:

 *
 * @return A bundle object to use for local asset loading. Must not be nil.
 *
 * @discussion If not implemented, the application manager will use [NSBundle mainBundle]
