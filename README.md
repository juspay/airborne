# Hyper OTA: Seamless Over-The-Air Updates for Your Applications

Hyper OTA empowers developers to effortlessly integrate Over-The-Air (OTA) update capabilities into their **Android, iOS, and React Native applications**. Our primary focus is to provide robust, easy-to-use SDKs and plugins that streamline the update process directly within your client applications.

Optionally, for those who require full control over the update infrastructure, Hyper OTA also offers a comprehensive backend server.

## ‚ú® Empower Your Apps with OTA Updates: Key SDK Features

Hyper OTA's SDKs and plugins are designed to make OTA updates a breeze:

*   **Effortless Integration**: Lightweight SDKs for native Android and iOS, plus a dedicated plugin for React Native applications.
*   **Client-Side Control**: Manage update checks, downloads, and installations directly from your application code.
*   **Flexible Update Strategies**: Implement various update flows, such as silent updates, user-prompted updates, or forced updates.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency**: The React Native plugin ensures a consistent OTA experience across both Android and iOS.
*   **Open Source**: Our SDKs are open source, allowing for transparency, customization, and community contributions.

## üöÄ Core Components: SDKs First

Hyper OTA is primarily about enabling your applications with powerful update mechanisms:

*   **[Hyper OTA Android SDK](android/README.md)**: Integrate OTA update capabilities directly into your native Android applications. This lightweight SDK provides the tools to check for, download, and apply updates seamlessly. (Further details in its README).
*   **[Hyper OTA iOS SDK](iOS/README.md)**: Similarly, equip your native iOS applications with OTA functionality using our dedicated iOS SDK. (Further details in its README).
*   **[Hyper OTA React Native Plugin](react-plugin/README.md)**: The ideal solution for React Native developers. This plugin allows you to manage OTA updates across both Android and iOS platforms with a unified JavaScript API. (Further details in its README).
*   **[Hyper OTA React Native Example](react-example/README.md)**: A practical example application demonstrating how to use the Hyper OTA React Native Plugin and integrate it with an update source. (Further details in its README).

### Optional Add-on: The Hyper OTA Server

For developers who need a self-hosted backend solution to manage and distribute updates:

*   **[Hyper OTA Server](server/README.md)**: A robust backend system that can manage application versions, store update packages, and deliver them to your SDK-integrated applications.
    *   **Key functionalities**: User authentication (via Keycloak), organization/application management, package storage, release configurations, and a dashboard UI.
    *   **Technology stack**: Rust (Actix Web), PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Docker, LocalStack (for AWS emulation).
    *   **Note**: While powerful, using this server is optional. The SDKs can be configured to work with other update distribution mechanisms if preferred.

## üèÅ Getting Started with Hyper OTA SDKs

Integrating OTA updates into your application is straightforward:

1.  **Choose Your SDK/Plugin**:
    *   For **native Android** applications: Use the [Hyper OTA Android SDK](android/README.md).
    *   For **native iOS** applications: Use the [Hyper OTA iOS SDK](iOS/README.md).
    *   For **React Native** applications: Use the [Hyper OTA React Native Plugin](react-plugin/README.md). Refer to the [Hyper OTA React Native Example](react-example/README.md) for a practical guide.

2.  **Integrate into Your Project**: Follow the specific installation and setup instructions provided in the README of your chosen SDK/plugin.

3.  **Configure Update Source**: Point your SDK/plugin to an update source. This could be the optional Hyper OTA Server or any other compatible update distribution mechanism.

4.  **Implement Update Logic**: Use the SDK/plugin APIs to check for updates, download them, and apply them according to your application's requirements.

### Setting up the Optional Hyper OTA Server

If you choose to use the self-hosted Hyper OTA Server:

**Prerequisites:**

*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Git

**One-Command Setup (from the `server` directory):**

1.  **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd hyper-ota/server
    ```
2.  **Start the Server**:
    *   Development mode (with hot-reloading):
        ```bash
        ./run.sh dev
        ```
    *   For other run options (build, production, detach), see the [Hyper OTA Server README](server/README.md).

**Services Started by `./run.sh dev`:**

*   **Backend API**: `http://localhost:8081`
*   **Keycloak (Authentication)**: `http://localhost:8180` (Default admin: `admin/admin`)
*   And other development services like LocalStack, Superposition, and PostgreSQL.

For more detailed server setup, API routes, database schema, and ACL information, please refer to the **[Hyper OTA Server README](server/README.md)**.
